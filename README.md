# StoryTime

This MERN stack app is designed to help incentivise readers to keep active and track their progress. They can add new books, look back at the reading logs of their old books and even share their novel insights to the public posts page, where others can give them a "like". To look at the app just click [here](https://storytime-matt.herokuapp.com/). You will first be brought to a SignUp/Login page where you can setup an account.
